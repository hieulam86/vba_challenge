# vba_challenge

In this vba project, I have done a number of tasks over a list of stocks as the following:

1. Looping through the stocks in 3 different years (2018, 2019 and 2020)

2. Calculating yearly change, percentage change and total volume in each stock

3. Determining which stock was the best gainer, the worst loser and the highest volume

4. Conditional formatting to which stock was underperformed (in red) and overperformed (in green)

5. Outputting values into a summary table
